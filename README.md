# Refile::Postgres

A PostgreSQL backend for [Refile](https://github.com/elabs/refile).

## Why?

* You want to store all your data in one place to simplify backups and replication
* ACID

## Take into account

* Gem is developed and tested using Postgresql 9.3, Ruby 2.1 and ActiveRecord 4.x. It might work with earlier versions.
* Performance hit storing files in database
* Higher memory requirements for database
* Backups can take significantly longer

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'refile-postgres'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install refile-postgres

## Usage with Rails

    $ rails g refile:postgres:migration
